## FAQ

### Why yet another type adblock detector library?

There are many adblock detector modules on npm, unfortunately, I couldn't find any that fit my needs:

* Comprehensive test suite
* Covers all browsers atleast except IE
* Unsurprising behavior
* Well-maintained
* Modern logic

The most common problems I noticed in these modules was they are having unncessary logic, following some big list of rules. But the adblockers have become more smart and effective in blocking ads.
