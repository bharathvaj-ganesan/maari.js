Note: It's famous mass dialogue from South Indian film.

## Features

* Simple and Tiny library (Less than 1KB in size)
* Zero Dependency
* Currenty Supports all modern browsers except IE
* CDN support

### Getting started

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/maari/dist/maari.min.js"></script>
```

### Usuage

```js
const alertUser = () => {
	alert('Please turn off the ad blocker');
};

maari(alertUser);
```

Callback will be executed if adblock is detected.

## FAQ

### Why yet another adblock detector library?

There are many adblock detector modules on npm, unfortunately, I couldn't find any that fit my needs:

* Comprehensive test suite
* Covers all browsers atleast except IE
* Unsurprising behavior
* Well-maintained
* Modern logic

The most common problems I noticed in these modules was they are having unncessary logic, following some big list of rules. But the adblockers have become more smart and effective in blocking ads.
